[Proxy-Auto-Detect should handle smoothly multiple proxy URL](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=763296)

section:
" Proxy Configuration
       The environment variable http_proxy is supported for system wide configuration. Proxies
       specific to APT can be configured via the option Acquire::http::Proxy. Proxies which
       should be used only for certain hosts can be specified via Acquire::http::Proxy::host.
       Even more finegrained control can be achieved via proxy autodetection, detailed further
       below."

section:
"   Automatic Proxy Configuration
       Acquire::http::Proxy-Auto-Detect can be used to specify an external command to discover
       the HTTP proxy to use. The first and only parameter is a URI denoting the host to be
       contacted, to allow for host-specific configuration. APT expects the command to output the
       proxy on stdout as a single line in the previously specified URI format or the word DIRECT
       if no proxy should be used. No output indicates that the generic proxy settings should be
       used.

       Note that auto-detection will not be used for a host if a host-specific proxy
       configuration is already set via Acquire::http::Proxy::host.

       See the squid-deb-proxy-client(1) and auto-apt-proxy(1) packages for example
       implementations.

       This option takes precedence over the legacy option name Acquire::http::ProxyAutoDetect."
